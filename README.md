A web application to book condos and townhouses on vacation spots. An exact simulation of HomeAway website. Multi step improval of the technology stack.


## React + Node.js + MySQL
- The first version of the full stack application
- Front-end was supported by React with basic class based components to reduce the redundancy
- Express-sessions were used to maintain user sessions
- Rest APIs with axios requests were used to make a call from front-end server to back-end server
- The node server was connected to MySQL database
